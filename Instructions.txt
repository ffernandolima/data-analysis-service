Statement of Work
You must build a data analysis system 100% coded in C#. The system must be able to import
lots of flat files, read and analyse the data, and output a report.
Please read the following for more information about the input files, data analysis and the
needed output.

Flat file layout
There are 3 kinds of data inside those files. For each kind of data there is a different layout.

Salesman data
Salesman data has the format id 001 and the line will have the following format.
001ÁCPFÁNameÁSalary

Customer data
Customer data has the format id 002 and the line will have the following format.
002ÁCNPJÁNameÁBusiness Area

Sales data
Sales data has the format id 003. Inside the sales row, there is the list of items, which is
wrapped by square brackets []. The line will have the following format.
003ÁSale IDÁ[Item ID-Item Quantity-Item Price]ÁSalesman name

Sample file data
The following is a sample of the data that the application should be able to read. Note that this is a sample, real data could be 100% different.

001Á1234567891234ÁDiegoÁ50000
001Á3245678865434ÁRenatoÁ40000.99
002Á2345675434544345ÁJose da SilvaÁRural
002Á2345675433444345ÁEduardo PereiraÁRural
003Á10Á[1-10-100,2-30-2.50,3-40-3.10]ÁDiego
003Á08Á[1-34-10,2-33-1.50,3-40-0.10]ÁRenato

Data analysis
Your system must read data from the default directory, located at %HOMEPATH%/data/in. The
system must only read .dat files.
After processing all files inside the input default directory, the system must create a flat file
inside the default output directory, located at %HOMEPATH%/data/out. The filename must follow this pattern, {flat_file_name}.done.dat.

The output file contents should summarize the following data:
ï	Amount of clients in the input file
ï	Amount of salesman in the input file
ï	ID of the most expensive sale
ï	Worst salesman ever
This application should be running all the time, without any breaks. Everytime new files become available, everything should be executed.

Application Construction
As long as you code in C# (choose whatever version you like) you are free to build whatever
kind application you feel that's suitable for the job (web, winform or console).
You have total freedom to google everything you need, and ask also questions if you want to.
Feel free to pick any external library if you need so.
The score will not be affected if you do not use any external libraries. Just keep in mind the
criterias above. Good luck :)
